This is a project I worked on in CS 251 that imitated a search engine by indexing key words and pairing them to URLs. This was done using a Map data structure and by setting the keys to the keywords and the values to a set of associated URLs. To run this program you will have to specify a filename that matches one of the .txt files in the folder and run main.cpp.
